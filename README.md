### File I/O

The file I/O mini-project may be found in the `fio/` directory. The `readData.js` script reads the data in the `fio/data` directory asynchronously and outputs the collection of all this data to the console. The `readDataSequentially.js` script does the same thing but sequentially.

Data can be created using the `createData.js` script as follows:
```
$ node createData.js N
```
where `N` is the number of data files you wish to create.
